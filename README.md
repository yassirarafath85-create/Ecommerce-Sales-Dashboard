## process:
Data Import
Loaded multiple datasets including Orders and Details into Power BI.

Data Cleaning & Transformation
Handled missing values, standardized fields, corrected data types, and removed duplicates using Power Query.

- Data Modeling:

  Established relationships between tables and built a star-schema model for efficient analysis.

- DAX Measures Creation:

  Created KPIs such as Total Sales, Profit, Quantity, Profit Margin, YoY Growth, and Category-wise metrics.

- Visualization Development:

  Designed interactive charts and visual elements for sales trends, product performance, customer insights, and regional analysis.

- Dashboard Design:

  Built a clean, user-friendly layout with slicers, filters, drill-throughs, and dynamic interactions.

- Insights & Storytelling:

  Highlighted key findings and trends to support decision-making

## Project Insights:
The analysis revealed clear sales patterns across products, regions, and customer segments. High-performing categories consistently contributed a major share of revenue, while certain low-margin items showed strong sales volume but weaker profitability. Regional performance varied significantly, highlighting areas with untapped potential. Customer analysis showed that a small percentage of loyal, high-value customers generated a large portion of total sales. Monthly trends indicated noticeable seasonality, and discount patterns showed that aggressive discounting did not always lead to higher profit. These insights help identify where the business can optimize pricing, focus marketing efforts, and improve product strategies.

## Conclusion:
This Power BI Sales Dashboard successfully combines multiple datasets into a clean, interactive analytical tool that simplifies decision-making. It demonstrates end-to-end BI capabilities including data cleaning, modeling, DAX calculations, and visualization design while providing clear insights into sales performance and business growth opportunities. The dashboard can be expanded further with forecasting, customer segmentation models, or automated refresh pipelines, making it a strong foundation for advanced analytics and real-world business use.
